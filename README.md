# Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning-CAP6673
This repository contains all coursework from CAP 6673 Data Mining and Machine Learning at Florida Atlantic University. **There is a lot of repetitive code that I would've been better off defining functions for and I hope to fix this soon.**

Assignments, datasets, etc. can all be found at http://www.cse.fau.edu/~taghi/classes/cap6673/. For Assignment 4, references #5 and #9 are research papers describing the process of Module Ordering Modeling and can be found at http://www.cse.fau.edu/~taghi/classes/cap6673/references/references.html. All work was orginally done in Weka's GUI but I have since adapted all code to run in R with the RWeka package.
